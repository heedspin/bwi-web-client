+ `smash compile`: compile the project source into unoptiimized HTML, JS and CSS ready for the browser
+ `smash serve`: run a BrowserSync-based development server and re-compile on file changes
+ `smash build`: build the compiled source into a minified, otpimized set of files for deployment
+ `smash docs`: generate a static documentation site for this codebase
